# Side-Window-Filter---python-opencv-  
This is a personal python implementation of CVPR 2019 paper [Side Window Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07177).

You can get original matlab code in [SideWindowFilter](https://github.com/YuanhaoGong/SideWindowFilter), I tried to keep the idea
of the original code. I find this paer very interesing, it is better than the traditional average filtering, but not complicated at 
all. Expect more filters from the author.
